  "description": "Three vases are arranged side by side on a gray, smooth surface. The vases are white in color, each with a round base and a tall stem. They are positioned in a straight line, their surfaces touching the gray surface. A single, faint white flower is placed in one vase, its petals gently curling toward the center. The space between the vases is filled with soft, earthy tones, creating a harmonious visual contrast. The action of the flowers causing slight vibrations is visible as they sway slightly.",
