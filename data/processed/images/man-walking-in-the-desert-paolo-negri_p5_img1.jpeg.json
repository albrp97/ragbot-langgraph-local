  "description": "There are two giraffes and a zebra standing next to each other. The scene features vibrant red and yellow hues, with the giraffes having long necks and the zebra sporting a white coat. A small, green leafy plant is positioned between them, creating a natural barrier. The two giraffes are actively grazing on grass, while the zebra moves gracefully along the ground, their bodies showing signs of activity. The arrangement suggests a peaceful and serene environment, with clear spatial relationships between the animals and the nearby object.",
