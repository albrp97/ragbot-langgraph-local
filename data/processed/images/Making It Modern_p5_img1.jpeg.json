  "description": "There is a vase with a seahorse design, its body adorned with soft pink hues and flowing white petals that create a serene visual impact. The seahorse is positioned in a circular arrangement, its head and tail gracefully spiraling outward, suggesting a natural and elegant form. A small wooden handle supports the vase, adding to its decorative appeal. The seahorse's body is illuminated by a soft blue light, casting an ethereal glow over the piece. This design invites both artistic expression and a sense of tranquility.",
