  "description": "There is a vase with an owl design on its surface, featuring a stylized owl with a pointed head and wings. The vase is made of a dark red wood that has been polished to a smooth finish. The design includes intricate patterns on the top and sides, creating a vibrant visual effect. A small white ceramic tile sits beside the vase, adding a playful touch. The space between the vase and the tile is filled with soft blue lighting, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The owl's eyes are large and expressive, casting a gentle glow onto the object.",
