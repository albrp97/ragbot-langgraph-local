Colors are absent, emphasizing a flat, analytical view. The layout shows spatial relationships clearly, with major cities and regions arranged in logical order. The image includes visible labels and annotations for navigation purposes, highlighting the map's utility for travelers or researchers. No hallucinations or embellishments are present in the description.",
